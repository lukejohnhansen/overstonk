alphavantage API key: U90REPENYRGJX7M6

Here I am, on my Manjaro KDE Plasma partition of my gaming rig, ready to head down the (definitely) long and (possibly)
tedious rabbit-hole known as "Creating a data pipeline to monitor stocks" D: I don't know whether to be excited, or
scared out of my wits. Well, pitter patter - let's get at 'er.

###Task 1: Setup the issue tracking system - Oct 9, 2020
I'm not the most organized person on earth (let's just say I'm a bit of  a pro-crastinator, ha ha ha ;D ...) and I found
that using some sort of issue tracking system is a must-have to prioritise work. I'll be using Trello, as Jira seems a 
bit too ... over-the-top for a one-man mission. I'll still be following the Kanban style board, though. The board is now
up and available here: <https://trello.com/b/vw7LBacD/overstonk-personal-project>

Such a professional name c:

###Task 2: Add some issues to the Trello backlog - Oct 12, 2020
A Kanban board without any tickets is just sad to look at (and I specifically made the background pink so that I wouldn't
be sad ;D ), so let's add some items to it:
1. OS-1 Read API docs for Alphavantage
2. OS-2 Research Apache Nifi for data ingestion
3. OS-3 Setup service to ingest data
